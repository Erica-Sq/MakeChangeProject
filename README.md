# MakeChangeProject

I completed this project in Java, using eclipse as my framework. I learned how important it is to maintain the curly brackets around the proper sections of the scope. I had to play with the placement of the sys out for every piece of work need a read out. I've learned through trial and error that a line of code in the wrong place, will not only fail to execute the line, but also prevent the rest of the code from executing. 

This project functions as a store register. It accepts input for sales and cash tendered. It then is able to calculate if there is any change due, and indicates in what denominations of dollars and coins the change could be given.
